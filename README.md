Mini Lathe Design and Build
I designed and built a mini lathe for metal processing. This project showcases my skills in mechanical design, precision engineering, and hands-on fabrication. The mini lathe is capable of performing precise metalworking tasks and demonstrates my ability to take a concept from initial design through to a fully functional tool. This project involved aspects of mechanical engineering, electronics, and control systems, reflecting my multidisciplinary expertise.
